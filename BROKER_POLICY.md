# 🛡️ HORUS Philosophy: Trust, Hedge Funds, and Broker Resistance

HORUS is built for individual traders—**not hedge funds, brokers, or market-making institutions**.

## Why Brokers Won’t Like HORUS

Most brokers profit when retail traders lose or make mistakes. Platforms that genuinely help users win—by offering advanced insights and risk management—are often met with resistance by industry insiders. Brokers and institutional players prefer maintaining their edge, not seeing it eroded by powerful tools accessible to everyone.

## Why Hedge Funds Aren’t Welcome

While hedge funds leverage proprietary technology to maximize returns, they often do so at the expense of smaller, individual market participants. Sharing HORUS’s unique algorithms or strategies with these entities would undermine the mission to empower solo traders.

## Empowering Real Traders

- **HORUS is closed source** to protect its edge for individuals, prevent institutional misuse, and avoid broker interference.
- We openly reject any requests from hedge funds, brokers, or similar organizations.
- Our goal is to **level the playing field**, not reinforce existing power structures.
